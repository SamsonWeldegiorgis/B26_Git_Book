KIDS SAYâ€¦
Shakespeare and Einstein had some good sound bites but the true wordsmiths of our time are toddlers. Offering over 80 spots to jot down your little one's thoughts on puppies, rain, and world peace, this softcover booklet lets you both look back on their cutest observations and witty one-liners. Space for photos lets you put a sweet quote to a sweeter face. Handmade in Colorado.
